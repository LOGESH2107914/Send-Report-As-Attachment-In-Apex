ðŸŒŸ Scenario: Weekly Sales Report for External Stakeholders

ðŸŒŸ Situation: You need to share a weekly report summarizing key sales account metrics (e.g., open opportunities, total sales value) with external stakeholders who don't have Salesforce access.

ðŸŒŸ Challenges: Salesforce Report has a Limitations that scheduling can't directly email reports to external users.

As a workaround, we can create a logic in Apex that extracts the report(s) and send an email to external users. To schedule it every week, you can use Scheduled Apex ðŸ™‚

You can either send a report in .csv format or a printable format and this approach saves a lot of time from building a report in apex.
